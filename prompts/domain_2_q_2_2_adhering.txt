Domain 2 – Question 2.2 (Effect of Adhering to Intervention)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Prompt:
You are evaluating Risk of Bias Domain 2 for the “Effect of Adhering to Intervention.”
This is Question 2.2:
“Were there deviations from intended intervention that were not caused by the trial context?”

Read the provided document.

Your tasks:

1. Identify deviations from the intended intervention that occurred for reasons 
   unrelated to the experimental context.
   These may include:
     - participants failing to adhere due to personal reasons,
     - missed doses, dropped appointments, partial compliance,
     - treatment discontinuation due to side effects,
     - changes in behavior or treatment that occur normally in real-world settings.

2. These deviations *are not* considered caused by the trial context if:
     - they reflect natural variability in adherence,
     - they would have occurred similarly outside clinical research,
     - they are unrelated to participant or clinician awareness of assignment,
     - they stem from routine clinical decision-making.

3. Distinguish these from deviations caused by trial procedures (Question 2.1),
   which you should NOT count here.

4. Return one of the following:
   Y  = Yes (non–trial-context deviations occurred)
   PY = Probably Yes
   NI = No Information
   PN = Probably No
   N  = No (no evidence of such deviations)

5. Provide a short justification explaining why the chosen answer is appropriate.

6. Quote exact sentences or phrases from the document that support your conclusion.

7. If no relevant information about these deviations is available in the document, answer NI.

Output format:

Answer: <Y | PY | NI | PN | N>
Justification: <2–4 sentences explaining reasoning>
Quoted Evidence:
"<exact text copied from the document>"
