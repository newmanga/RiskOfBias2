Domain 2 – Question 2.3 (Effect of Adhering to Intervention)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Prompt:
You are evaluating Risk of Bias Domain 2 for the “Effect of Adhering to Intervention.”
This is Question 2.3:
“Were important deviations from intended intervention balanced across groups?”

Read the provided document.

Your tasks:

1. Determine whether deviations identified in Questions 2.1 and 2.2 occurred
   similarly across intervention groups or were imbalanced.

2. Deviations are considered unbalanced if:
     - they occur more frequently in one intervention arm,
     - the type or severity differs across groups,
     - reasons for non-adherence differ meaningfully between groups,
     - one group experiences more co-interventions, supplemental treatments,
       or protocol departures than the other.

3. Deviations are considered balanced if:
     - both groups exhibit similar adherence patterns,
     - deviations appear randomly distributed,
     - co-interventions and protocol departures are comparable.

4. If no deviations occurred in either group, answer:
     N = No (no unbalanced deviations)

5. Return one of the following:
   Y  = Yes (deviations were unbalanced)
   PY = Probably Yes
   NI = No Information
   PN = Probably No
   N  = No (deviations were balanced or none occurred)

6. Provide a short justification explaining why the chosen answer is appropriate.

7. Quote exact sentences or phrases from the document that support your conclusion.

8. If no relevant information about group-wise deviations is provided, answer NI.

Output format:

Answer: <Y | PY | NI | PN | N>
Justification: <2–4 sentences explaining reasoning>
Quoted Evidence:
"<exact text copied from the document>"
