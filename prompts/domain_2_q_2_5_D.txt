Domain 2 – Question 2.5 (Effect of Adhering to Intervention)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Prompt:
You are evaluating Risk of Bias Domain 2 for the “Effect of Adhering to Intervention.”
This is Question 2.5:
“Was an appropriate analysis used to estimate the effect of adhering to the intervention?”

Read the provided document.

Your tasks:

1. Determine whether the analysis appropriately estimates the per-protocol (adherence-based) effect,
   rather than the intention-to-treat (ITT) effect.

2. Appropriate analyses for the *effect of adhering* typically include:
     - instrumental variable analyses (e.g., using randomization as an instrument),
     - analyses adjusting for post-randomization variables that influence adherence,
     - structural equation models estimating adherence effects,
     - principal stratification approaches,
     - methods that appropriately account for confounding introduced by non-adherence.

3. Analyses that are *not* appropriate for estimating adherence effects include:
     - simple per-protocol analyses without adjustment for confounders,
     - as-treated analyses that ignore the randomized design,
     - analyses that exclude non-adherent participants without addressing bias,
     - any approach that conditions on adherence without correcting for confounding.

4. Identify whether the study provides:
     - details on the analytic method,
     - justification of assumptions,
     - evidence that confounding due to adherence was addressed.

5. Return one of the following:
   Y  = Yes (analysis appropriate for estimating adherence effect)
   PY = Probably Yes
   NI = No Information
   PN = Probably No
   N  = No (analysis inappropriate)

6. Provide a short justification explaining why the chosen answer is appropriate.

7. Quote exact sentences or phrases from the document that support your conclusion.

8. If the analysis method is not described or is insufficient to judge appropriateness, answer NI.

Output format:

Answer: <Y | PY | NI | PN | N>
Justification: <2–4 sentences explaining reasoning>
Quoted Evidence:
"<exact text copied from the document>"
