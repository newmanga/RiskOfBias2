Domain 2 – Question 2.2
-----------------------

Prompt:
You are evaluating Risk of Bias Domain 2, Question 2.2:
“Were carers and people delivering the interventions aware of participants’ assigned intervention during the trial?”

Read the provided document.

Your tasks:

1. Determine whether carers, clinicians, nurses, or intervention deliverers were blinded.
   They are considered aware if:
     - They were told the allocation,
     - They could identify the intervention based on its characteristics,
     - Blinding was not implemented or was broken,
     - The intervention required active involvement making blinding impossible (e.g., surgery, psychotherapy).

2. Determine whether carers were probably unaware (e.g., identical placebos, matching procedures).

3. Identify whether the document reports blinding of carers or intervention administrators explicitly or implicitly.

4. Return one of the following:
   Y  = Yes (carers were aware)
   PY = Probably Yes
   NI = No Information
   PN = Probably No
   N  = No (carers were unaware)

5. Provide a short justification explaining why the chosen answer is appropriate.

6. Quote exact sentences or phrases from the document that support your conclusion.

7. If no information is available about carer blinding or awareness, answer NI.

Output format:

Answer: <Y | PY | NI | PN | N>
Justification: <2–4 sentences explaining reasoning>
Quoted Evidence:
"<exact text copied from the document>"
