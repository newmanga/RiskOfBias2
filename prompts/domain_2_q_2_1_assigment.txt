Domain 2 – Question 2.1 (Effect of Assigment to Intervention)
-----------------------

Prompt:
You are evaluating Risk of Bias Domain 2, Question 2.1:
“Were participants aware of their assigned intervention during the trial?”

Read the provided document.

Your tasks:

1. Determine whether participants were blinded to the intervention they received.
   Participants are considered aware if:
     - They were told their allocation,
     - The intervention was obviously identifiable (e.g., surgery vs. no surgery),
     - They could infer their assignment from noticeable differences,
     - There is evidence that blinding was broken.

2. Determine whether participants were probably unaware (e.g., placebos indistinguishable from active treatment).

3. Identify whether the document explicitly or implicitly reports participant awareness or blinding.

4. Return one of the following:
   Y  = Yes (participants were aware)
   PY = Probably Yes
   NI = No Information
   PN = Probably No
   N  = No (participants were unaware)

5. Provide a short justification explaining why the chosen answer is appropriate.

6. Quote exact sentences or phrases from the document that support your conclusion.

7. If the document does not report participant blinding or awareness, answer NI.

Output format:

Answer: <Y | PY | NI | PN | N>
Justification: <2–4 sentences explaining reasoning>
Quoted Evidence:
"<exact text copied from the document>"
