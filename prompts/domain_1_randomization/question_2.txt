Domain 1 – Question 1.2
-----------------------

Prompt:
You are evaluating Risk of Bias Domain 1, Question 1.2:
“Was the allocation sequence concealed until participants were enrolled and assigned to interventions?”

Read the provided document.

Your tasks:

1. Identify whether allocation concealment was implemented.

   Adequate concealment methods include:
     - central randomization
     - pharmacy-controlled allocation
     - identical drug containers prepared by a third party
     - opaque, sealed, sequentially numbered envelopes
     - telephone or web-based randomization services
     - any method that prevents prediction of upcoming assignments

   Inadequate concealment signals include:
     - open allocation lists
     - non-opaque envelopes
     - envelopes that are unsealed or sequentially predictable
     - investigator access to the sequence
     - predictable block sizes known to recruiting staff
     - any indication that allocations could be foreseen or manipulated

2. Return one of the following:
   Y  = Yes
   PY = Probably Yes
   NI = No Information
   PN = Probably No
   N  = No

3. Provide a short justification explaining why the chosen answer is appropriate.

4. Quote exact sentences or phrases from the document that support your conclusion.

5. If no relevant information is available in the document, answer NI.

Output format:

Answer: <Y | PY | NI | PN | N>
Justification: <2–4 sentences explaining reasoning>
Quoted Evidence:
