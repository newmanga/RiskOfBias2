Domain 2 – Question 2.4
-----------------------

Prompt:
You are evaluating Risk of Bias Domain 2, Question 2.4:
“Were these deviations from intended intervention likely to have affected the outcome?”

Read the provided document.

Your tasks:

1. Examine any deviations identified in the study and determine whether they could plausibly influence the outcome.
   Deviations may affect outcomes if they:
     - change the amount, type, or timing of intervention received,
     - introduce systematic differences between groups,
     - alter co-interventions,
     - create behavioral changes relevant to outcomes.

2. Consider whether the deviations:
     - are directly related to the intervention,
     - would plausibly bias the results in favor of or against an intervention,
     - impact clinical or behavioral mechanisms related to the outcome.

3. If no deviations were identified in Question 2.3, answer:
     N = No

4. If deviations occurred but appear minor, balanced, or clinically irrelevant, consider:
     PN = Probably No

5. If deviations occurred and have a clear or probable effect on outcomes, consider:
     Y or PY

6. Return one of the following:
   Y  = Yes (deviations likely affected the outcome)
   PY = Probably Yes
   NI = No Information (insufficient details to judge)
   PN = Probably No
   N  = No (unlikely to affect outcome)

7. Provide a short justification explaining why the chosen answer is appropriate.

8. Quote exact sentences or phrases from the document that support your conclusion.

9. If no relevant information is provided about the impact of deviations on outcomes, answer NI.

Output format:

Answer: <Y | PY | NI | PN | N>
Justification: <2–4 sentences explaining reasoning>
Quoted Evidence:
"<exact text copied from the document>"
