Domain 2 – Question 2.4 (Effect of Adhering to Intervention)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Prompt:
You are evaluating Risk of Bias Domain 2 for the “Effect of Adhering to Intervention.”
This is Question 2.4:
“Were these deviations from intended intervention likely to have affected the outcome?”

Read the provided document.

Your tasks:

1. Examine the deviations identified in Questions 2.1–2.3 and assess whether they
   could plausibly influence the study outcome under a per-protocol (adherence-focused) interpretation.

2. Deviations are likely to affect the outcome if they:
     - alter the intervention actually received,
     - significantly change dose, duration, or fidelity of intervention delivery,
     - introduce meaningful differences in adherence levels between groups,
     - introduce clinically relevant co-interventions,
     - are linked to mechanisms influencing outcomes.

3. Deviations are unlikely to affect outcomes if:
     - they are minor,
     - they occur similarly in all groups,
     - they are unrelated to the causal pathway of the outcome,
     - the study provides evidence they had negligible influence.

4. If no deviations were reported at all, answer:
     N = No

5. Return one of the following:
   Y  = Yes (deviations likely influenced outcomes)
   PY = Probably Yes
   NI = No Information
   PN = Probably No
   N  = No (unlikely to influence outcomes)

6. Provide a short justification explaining why the chosen answer is appropriate.

7. Quote exact sentences or phrases from the document that support your conclusion.

8. If the impact of deviations on outcomes is not addressed, answer NI.

Output format:

Answer: <Y | PY | NI | PN | N>
Justification: <2–4 sentences explaining reasoning>
Quoted Evidence:
"<exact text copied from the document>"
