Domain 2 – Question 2.1 (Effect of Adhering to Intervention)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Prompt:
You are evaluating Risk of Bias Domain 2 for the “Effect of Adhering to Intervention.”
This is Question 2.1:
“Were there deviations from the intended intervention that arose because of the trial context?”

Read the provided document.

Your tasks:

1. Identify whether any deviations from the intended intervention occurred because of the experimental context.
   Deviations arise from the trial context when:
     - they were caused by study procedures (e.g., enhanced monitoring, study visits, protocol-driven actions),
     - they occurred because participants or carers were influenced by the knowledge that this was a research study,
     - they would *not* have occurred in normal clinical practice.

2. Examples include:
     - patients modifying behavior due to study participation,
     - clinicians altering treatment based on trial assignment knowledge,
     - protocol-driven deviations intended only for the study,
     - study-specific co-interventions.

3. Deviations *not* due to the trial context include:
     - routine clinical variations,
     - adherence problems occurring in normal clinical environments,
     - deviations unrelated to study processes.

4. Return one of the following:
   Y  = Yes (deviations due to trial context occurred)
   PY = Probably Yes
   NI = No Information
   PN = Probably No
   N  = No (no deviations due to trial context)

5. Provide a short justification explaining why the chosen answer is appropriate.

6. Quote exact sentences or phrases from the document that support your conclusion.

7. If no information is provided about the nature or causes of deviations, answer NI.

Output format:

Answer: <Y | PY | NI | PN | N>
Justification: <2–4 sentences explaining reasoning>
Quoted Evidence:
"<exact text copied from the document>"
