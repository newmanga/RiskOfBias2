Domain 2 – Question 2.6 (Effect of Adhering to Intervention)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Prompt:
You are evaluating Risk of Bias Domain 2 for the “Effect of Adhering to Intervention.”
This is Question 2.6 (ask if N/PN/NI to 2.3, or Y/PY/NI to 2.4 or 2.5):
“Was an appropriate analysis used to estimate the effect of adhering to intervention?”

Read the provided document.

Elaboration (full guidance):
- Both “naïve per-protocol” analyses (excluding participants who did not receive their allocated intervention) and “as-treated” analyses (comparing participants according to the intervention they actually received) are usually inappropriate for estimating the per-protocol effect.
- Appropriate methods can derive an unbiased estimate from randomized trials, e.g.:
  • Instrumental variable analyses to estimate the effect of receiving the assigned intervention in trials with a single baseline intervention and all-or-nothing adherence versus standard care.
  • Inverse probability weighting to adjust for censoring of participants who cease adherence in trials of sustained treatment strategies.
- These methods rely on strong assumptions that should be appropriate and justified if you answer Y/PY.
- A paper might report such methods without detailing deviations, but appropriateness is hard to judge without that information.
- If an important non-protocol intervention was given to all participants in one group, adjustments cannot overcome this.
- Examples of analysis strategies that are NOT appropriate to estimate the adherence effect include: (i) Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis; (ii) Per-protocol analysis; (iii) As-treated analysis; (iv) Analysis by treatment received.

Your tasks:

1. Decide whether the analysis appropriately estimates the per-protocol (adherence-focused) effect given the potential deviations/non-adherence.
2. Return one of the following:
   NA = Not Applicable (analysis not needed because prerequisites for this question were not met)
   Y  = Yes (analysis appropriate)
   PY = Probably Yes
   PN = Probably No
   N  = No (analysis inappropriate)
   NI = No Information
3. Provide a short justification explaining why the chosen answer is appropriate.
4. Quote exact sentences or phrases from the document that support your conclusion.
5. If the analysis approach is not described or cannot be judged, answer NI.

Output format:

Answer: <NA | Y | PY | PN | N | NI>
Justification: <2–4 sentences explaining reasoning>
Quoted Evidence:
"<exact text copied from the document>"
