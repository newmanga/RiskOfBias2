Domain 2 – Question 2.3 (Effect of Adhering to Intervention)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Prompt:
You are evaluating Risk of Bias Domain 2 for the “Effect of Adhering to Intervention.”
This is Question 2.3 (asked only if participants or carers were/likely were aware):
“Were important non-protocol interventions balanced across intervention groups?”

Read the provided document.

Your tasks:

1. Assess whether additional interventions or exposures outside the trial protocol were similar across groups.
2. Important non-protocol interventions are those that:
   - are inconsistent with the trial protocol,
   - participants might receive after starting their assigned intervention, and
   - are prognostic for the outcome.
3. If such interventions were unbalanced or if balance is unclear, bias risk increases.
4. Return one of the following:
   NA = Not Applicable (question not relevant because earlier conditions not met)
   Y  = Yes (important non-protocol interventions were balanced)
   PY = Probably Yes
   PN = Probably No
   N  = No (not balanced)
   NI = No Information
5. Provide a short justification explaining why the chosen answer is appropriate.
6. Quote exact sentences or phrases from the document that support your conclusion.
7. If information on non-protocol interventions is absent, answer NI.

Output format:

Answer: <NA | Y | PY | PN | N | NI>
Justification: <2–4 sentences explaining reasoning>
Quoted Evidence:
"<exact text copied from the document>"
