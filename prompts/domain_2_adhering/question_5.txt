Domain 2 – Question 2.5 (Effect of Adhering to Intervention)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Prompt:
You are evaluating Risk of Bias Domain 2 for the “Effect of Adhering to Intervention.”
This is Question 2.5 (asked only if specified in preliminary considerations):
“Was there non-adherence to the assigned intervention regimen that could have affected participants’ outcomes?”

Read the provided document.

Your tasks:

1. Look for evidence of imperfect compliance, cessation of the intervention, crossovers to the comparator, or switches to another active intervention.
2. Consider the proportion continuing their assigned intervention throughout follow-up and whether any non-adherence could affect outcomes.
3. For interventions administered once where imperfect adherence is impossible and most participants received the assigned intervention, answer N.
4. Return one of the following:
   NA = Not Applicable (non-adherence not being assessed)
   Y  = Yes (non-adherence could have affected outcomes)
   PY = Probably Yes
   PN = Probably No
   N  = No (non-adherence unlikely to affect outcomes)
   NI = No Information
5. Provide a short justification explaining why the chosen answer is appropriate.
6. Quote exact sentences or phrases from the document that support your conclusion.
7. If non-adherence information is not reported, answer NI.

Output format:

Answer: <NA | Y | PY | PN | N | NI>
Justification: <2–4 sentences explaining reasoning>
Quoted Evidence:
"<exact text copied from the document>"
