Domain 2 – Question 2.3
-----------------------

Prompt:
You are evaluating Risk of Bias Domain 2, Question 2.3:
“Were there deviations from the intended intervention that arose because of the experimental context?”

Read the provided document.

Your tasks:

1. Identify whether any deviations from the assigned intervention occurred during the trial.
   Examples of deviations due to the experimental context include:
     - Participants receiving additional unplanned interventions,
     - Participants switching groups,
     - Changes in co-interventions,
     - Altered treatment behaviors influenced by trial participation or awareness of assignment.

2. Determine whether these deviations occurred specifically because participants, carers, or deliverers knew the assigned intervention 
   or because of trial-related procedures (e.g., enhanced monitoring, study-specific interactions).

3. Focus ONLY on deviations that:
     - were caused by the trial setting, OR
     - would not have occurred outside the research context.

4. Ignore deviations unrelated to the trial context (e.g., routine clinical variations not influenced by participation).

5. Return one of the following:
   Y  = Yes (deviations occurred because of the experimental context)
   PY = Probably Yes
   NI = No Information
   PN = Probably No
   N  = No (no evidence of such deviations)

6. Provide a short justification explaining why the chosen answer is appropriate.

7. Quote exact sentences or phrases from the document that support your conclusion.

8. If no information is provided about deviations or reasons for deviations, answer NI.

Output format:

Answer: <Y | PY | NI | PN | N>
Justification: <2–4 sentences explaining reasoning>
Quoted Evidence:
"<exact text copied from the document>"
