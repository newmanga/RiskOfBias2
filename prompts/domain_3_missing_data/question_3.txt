Domain 3 – Question 3.3 (Bias due to missing outcome data)
----------------------------------------------------------

Prompt:
You are evaluating Risk of Bias Domain 3:
“Bias due to missing outcome data.”

This is Question 3.3:
“Could missingness in the outcome depend on its true value?”

Read the provided document.

Your tasks:

1. Assess whether the likelihood of missing outcome data could plausibly depend on
   the participant’s true (unobserved) outcome value.

   This is a key question: bias is likely if the probability of missingness is related
   to what the participant’s outcome *would have been*.

2. Consider the following as evidence that missingness COULD depend on true outcome:
     - Participants withdrew due to worsening condition or lack of improvement,
     - Participants with adverse events failed to report outcomes,
     - Reasons for loss to follow-up relate to prognosis or outcome status,
     - Missing data occur disproportionately in one arm likely to have worse outcomes.

3. Consider the following as evidence that missingness is UNLIKELY to depend on true outcome:
     - Reasons for missingness are clearly unrelated to outcome (e.g., relocation),
     - Outcome data were collected after withdrawal from treatment,
     - Missingness is balanced and explained,
     - Trial design ensures outcome availability regardless of adherence.

4. If the reasons for missing outcome data are not reported, it is NOT SAFE to assume
   missingness is unrelated to true values.

5. Return one of the following:
   Y  = Yes (missingness could depend on true outcome)
   PY = Probably Yes
   NI = No Information
   PN = Probably No
   N  = No (unlikely missingness depends on true outcome)

6. Provide a short justification explaining why the chosen answer is appropriate.

7. Quote exact sentences or phrases from the document that support your conclusion.

8. If the document does not report reasons for missingness or any relevant details,
   answer NI.

Output format:

Answer: <Y | PY | NI | PN | N>
Justification: <2–4 sentences explaining reasoning>
Quoted Evidence:
"<exact text copied from the document>"
