Domain 3 – Question 3.4 (Bias due to missing outcome data)

Prompt:
You are evaluating Risk of Bias Domain 3: “Bias due to missing outcome data.”

This is Question 3.4:
“Is it likely that missing outcome data did NOT depend on true outcome values?”

Read the provided document.

Your tasks:

1. Determine whether it is likely that missing outcome data did not depend on the participant’s true (unobserved) outcome value.

2. Consider this question as the inverse of Question 3.3: you must judge whether missingness is plausibly unrelated to what the participant’s true outcome would have been.

3. Evidence that it IS LIKELY that missingness did not depend on true outcome includes:
   - Reasons for missingness are clearly unrelated to prognosis or outcome (e.g., relocation, administrative error).
   - Outcome collection continued after stopping the intervention.
   - Follow-up was nearly complete (e.g., >95% outcome data available).
   - Missingness was balanced across arms and adequately explained.
   - Trial procedures ensured outcome measurement even without adherence.

4. Evidence that it IS UNLIKELY that missingness is independent of true outcome includes:
   - Loss to follow-up due to worsening condition, lack of improvement, or adverse events.
   - Differential missingness between trial arms.
   - Participants with poor prognosis disproportionately lacking outcome data.
   - No explanation for missingness, making it impossible to assume independence.

5. If the document does not report the reasons for missing outcome data or does not provide enough detail to judge independence, answer NI (No Information).

6. Return one of the following:
   Y  = Yes (likely missingness did not depend on true outcome)
   PY = Probably Yes
   NI = No Information
   PN = Probably No
   N  = No (unlikely missingness is independent of true outcome)

7. Provide a short justification explaining why the chosen answer is appropriate.

8. Quote exact sentences or phrases from the document that support your conclusion.

Output format:

Answer: <Y | PY | NI | PN | N>
Justification: <2–4 sentences explaining reasoning>
Quoted Evidence:
"<exact text copied from the document>"
