Domain 3 – Question 3.1 (Bias due to missing outcome data)
----------------------------------------------------------

Prompt:
You are evaluating Risk of Bias Domain 3:
“Bias due to missing outcome data.”

This is Question 3.1:
“Were data for this outcome available for all, or nearly all, participants randomized?”

Read the provided document.

Your tasks:

1. Determine the number or proportion of randomized participants with available outcome data
   for the specific outcome being assessed.

2. Assess whether outcome data were available for:
     - all participants, or
     - “nearly all” participants, meaning that the number of participants with missing outcome data
       is small enough that their outcomes could not meaningfully affect the estimated effect.

   Notes:
     - For continuous outcomes, ~95% completeness often meets this criterion.
     - For dichotomous outcomes, the acceptable amount of missing data depends on event frequency.
     - Imputed values (e.g., LOCF, BOCF, multiple imputation) should be treated as missing
       for the purposes of this question.

3. Use information such as:
     - CONSORT flow diagrams,
     - tables of “participants analyzed,”
     - narrative descriptions of follow-up and retention.

4. Return one of the following:
   Y  = Yes
   PY = Probably Yes
   NI = No Information
   PN = Probably No
   N  = No

5. Provide a short justification explaining why the chosen answer is appropriate,
   citing the proportions or counts when possible.

6. Quote exact sentences or table entries from the document that support your conclusion.

7. If no information on missing outcome data is available for this outcome,
   answer NI.

Output format:

Answer: <Y | PY | NI | PN | N>
Justification: <2–4 sentences explaining reasoning>
Quoted Evidence:
"<exact text or table entries copied from the document>"
