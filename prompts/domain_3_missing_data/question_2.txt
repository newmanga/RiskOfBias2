Domain 3 – Question 3.2 (Bias due to missing outcome data)
----------------------------------------------------------

Prompt:
You are evaluating Risk of Bias Domain 3:
“Bias due to missing outcome data.”

This is Question 3.2:
“Is there evidence that the result was not biased by missing outcome data?”

Read the provided document.

Your tasks:

1. Determine whether the trial provides evidence that missing outcome data
   did NOT bias the estimated effect.

   Acceptable evidence includes:
     - Sensitivity analyses demonstrating robustness to missing data assumptions,
     - Explicit statements that missing data were minimal and unlikely to influence results,
     - Balanced missingness across groups AND missingness unrelated to outcomes,
     - Statistical approaches that appropriately handle missingness (e.g., model-based methods)
       *and* were justified by the authors.

2. Missing data are more likely NOT to bias results when:
     - missingness is very low,
     - missingness is clearly unrelated to true outcomes,
     - outcomes were obtained for all participants who discontinued treatment,
     - reasons for missingness are similar across study arms.

3. Missing data MAY bias results when:
     - participants lost to follow-up differ in prognosis,
     - reasons for missingness differ across intervention groups,
     - substantial proportion is missing,
     - sensitivity analyses are not presented or contradict main results.

4. Return one of the following:
   Y  = Yes (evidence shows missing data did not bias results)
   PY = Probably Yes
   NI = No Information
   PN = Probably No
   N  = No (evidence suggests missing data likely biased the results)

5. Provide a short justification explaining why the chosen answer is appropriate.

6. Quote exact sentences or phrases from the document that support your conclusion.

7. If there is no discussion or analysis of whether missing data influenced results,
   answer NI.

Output format:

Answer: <Y | PY | NI | PN | N>
Justification: <2–4 sentences explaining reasoning>
Quoted Evidence:
"<exact text or table entries copied from the document>"
