Domain 2 – Question 2.5
-----------------------

Prompt:
You are evaluating Risk of Bias Domain 2, Question 2.5:
“Were these deviations from intended intervention balanced between groups?”

Read the provided document.

Your tasks:

1. Determine whether any deviations from the intended intervention affected one group more than the other.
   Deviations are unbalanced if:
     - they occur primarily in one intervention arm,
     - the magnitude or frequency differs substantially,
     - one group receives additional or alternative treatments not mirrored in the other.

2. Balanced deviations include:
     - similar types and frequencies of deviations across groups,
     - co-interventions applied equally,
     - protocol departures affecting both groups comparably.

3. If no deviations were identified in Questions 2.3–2.4, answer:
     N = No (deviations not unbalanced)

4. If deviations occurred but the document suggests equal distribution, consider:
     PN or N

5. If deviations clearly favored or disadvantaged one group, consider:
     Y or PY

6. Return one of the following:
   Y  = Yes (deviations were unbalanced between groups)
   PY = Probably Yes
   NI = No Information
   PN = Probably No
   N  = No (deviations were balanced or none occurred)

7. Provide a short justification explaining why the chosen answer is appropriate.

8. Quote exact sentences or phrases from the document that support your conclusion.

9. If no relevant information is available about group-wise distribution of deviations, answer NI.

Output format:

Answer: <Y | PY | NI | PN | N>
Justification: <2–4 sentences explaining reasoning>
Quoted Evidence:
"<exact text copied from the document>"
