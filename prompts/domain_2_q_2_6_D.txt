Domain 2 – Question 2.6 (Effect of Adhering to Intervention)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Prompt:
You are evaluating Risk of Bias Domain 2 for the “Effect of Adhering to Intervention.”
This is Question 2.6:
“Was there a substantial risk of bias due to deviations from the intended interventions?”

Read the provided document.

Your tasks:

1. Review the evidence from Questions 2.1–2.5 to determine whether:
     - deviations from intended intervention occurred,
     - deviations arose from the trial context or routine practice,
     - deviations were unbalanced between groups,
     - deviations were likely to influence the outcome,
     - and whether the analysis appropriately estimated the adherence effect.

2. Assess the overall risk of bias based on the pattern of findings:
     - Consider **High risk** if important deviations occurred,
       were unbalanced, likely affected outcomes,
       and/or the analysis method was inappropriate.
     - Consider **Some concerns** if information is incomplete or uncertainties remain.
     - Consider **Low risk** if deviations were absent, balanced, unlikely to affect the outcome,
       and an appropriate adherence-effect analysis was used.

3. Return one of the following:
   Y  = Yes (there is substantial risk of bias)
   PY = Probably Yes
   NI = No Information
   PN = Probably No
   N  = No (no substantial risk)

4. Provide a short justification explaining why the chosen answer is appropriate,
   referencing earlier answers when relevant.

5. Quote exact sentences or phrases from the document that support your conclusion.
   If no relevant information is reported, answer NI and state that data is insufficient.

Output format:

Answer: <Y | PY | NI | PN | N>
Justification: <2–4 sentences explaining reasoning>
Quoted Evidence:
"<exact text copied from the document>"
