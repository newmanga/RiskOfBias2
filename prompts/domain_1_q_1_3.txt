Domain 1 – Question 1.3
-----------------------

Prompt:
You are evaluating Risk of Bias Domain 1, Question 1.3:
“Did baseline differences between intervention groups suggest a problem with the randomization process?”

Read the provided document.

Your tasks:

1. Look for any information about baseline characteristics, including tables or narrative descriptions.
   Compare the intervention groups for:
     - demographic variables (age, sex, etc.)
     - prognostic factors
     - disease severity
     - group sizes (whether they match expected allocation ratios)

2. Identify whether the differences:
     - are compatible with chance variation, or
     - suggest a potential failure of the randomization process.

   Concerning patterns include:
     - large or systematic imbalances in prognostic variables
     - many statistically significant baseline differences
     - extreme differences in group sizes inconsistent with the intended allocation ratio
     - implausibly similar baseline data (possible fabrication)
     - any indication that assignment was not truly random

3. Return one of the following:
   Y  = Yes (baseline differences strongly suggest a problem)
   PY = Probably Yes
   NI = No Information (no baseline details reported)
   PN = Probably No
   N  = No (differences appear consistent with chance)

4. Provide a short justification explaining why the chosen answer is appropriate.

5. Quote exact sentences or phrases from the document that support your conclusion.
   If no baseline information is available, answer NI and state that no relevant data was found.

Output format:

Answer: <Y | PY | NI | PN | N>
Justification: <2–4 sentences explaining reasoning>
Quoted Evidence:
"<exact text copied from the document>"
