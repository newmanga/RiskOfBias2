Domain 4 – Question 4.4 (Bias in measurement of the outcome)
------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt:
You are evaluating Risk of Bias Domain 4:
“Bias in measurement of the outcome.”

This is Question 4.4:
“Could assessment of the outcome have been influenced by knowledge of intervention received?”

Read the provided document.

Your tasks:

1. Consider whether the outcome is:
     - subjective (e.g., pain scores, quality of life, symptom ratings), OR
     - objective (e.g., mortality, lab values, imaging results).

   Subjective outcomes are more vulnerable to assessor influence.

2. Determine whether assessors' awareness of intervention (from Question 4.3)
   could plausibly influence how outcomes were measured, interpreted, or recorded.

3. Assessment could be influenced if:
     - the outcome requires judgment, interpretation, or scoring,
     - assessors might consciously or subconsciously rate groups differently,
     - interviews, observations, or clinician evaluations are involved,
     - intervention visibility may bias assessment.

4. Assessment is *unlikely* to be influenced if:
     - the outcome is objective and mechanically measured,
     - automated or laboratory-based processes are used,
     - outcome data are extracted from registries with standardized protocols.

5. If assessors were unaware of allocation (from Q4.3), influence is typically unlikely—
   but still confirm outcome type.

6. Return one of the following:
   Y  = Yes (outcome assessment could have been influenced)
   PY = Probably Yes
   NI = No Information
   PN = Probably No
   N  = No (influence unlikely)

7. Provide a short justification explaining why the chosen answer is appropriate.

8. Quote exact sentences or phrases from the document that support your conclusion.

9. If information about outcome type or susceptibility to influence is not reported, answer NI.

Output format:

Answer: <Y | PY | NI | PN | N>
Justification: <2–4 sentences explaining reasoning>
Quoted Evidence:
"<exact text copied from the document>"
