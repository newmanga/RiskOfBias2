Domain 4 – Question 4.2 (Bias in measurement of the outcome)
------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt:
You are evaluating Risk of Bias Domain 4:
“Bias in measurement of the outcome.”

This is Question 4.2:
“Could measurement or ascertainment of the outcome have differed between intervention groups?”

Read the provided document.

Your tasks:

1. Determine whether the procedures used to measure or ascertain outcomes were
   implemented differently across intervention groups.

   Differences may occur if:
     - different measurement instruments were used in each group,
     - outcome assessors collected data differently in each arm,
     - timing of measurement differed between groups,
     - follow-up schedules or assessment procedures were unequal,
     - different sources of information were used (e.g., medical records vs. self-report),
     - certain groups received additional diagnostic tests.

2. The measurement approach is considered equivalent when:
     - identical procedures and tools were used across groups,
     - timing and frequency of assessments were the same,
     - outcome ascertainment relied on objective data unlikely to vary between groups.

3. Consider whether any deviations in outcome ascertainment were:
     - intentional or unintentional,
     - likely or unlikely,
     - explicitly described or implicitly suggested.

4. Return one of the following:
   Y  = Yes (measurement could differ between groups)
   PY = Probably Yes
   NI = No Information
   PN = Probably No
   N  = No (measurement unlikely to differ between groups)

5. Provide a short justification explaining why the chosen answer is appropriate.

6. Quote exact sentences or phrases from the document that support your conclusion.

7. If no information is reported about whether measurement methods differed,
   answer NI.

Output format:

Answer: <Y | PY | NI | PN | N>
Justification: <2–4 sentences explaining reasoning>
Quoted Evidence:
"<exact text copied from the document>"
