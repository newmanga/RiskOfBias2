Domain 4 – Question 4.3 (Bias in measurement of the outcome)
------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt:
You are evaluating Risk of Bias Domain 4:
“Bias in measurement of the outcome.”

This is Question 4.3:
“Were outcome assessors aware of the intervention received by study participants?”

Read the provided document.

Your tasks:

1. Determine whether individuals responsible for measuring or assessing the outcome
   were blinded to participants’ assigned interventions.

2. Outcome assessors are considered *aware* if:
     - the document explicitly states they were unblinded,
     - they had access to treatment allocation information,
     - the nature of the intervention made blinding impossible (e.g., surgery),
     - they could infer allocation based on visible differences between groups.

3. Outcome assessors are considered *unaware* if:
     - blinding procedures were implemented and maintained,
     - the document explicitly states assessors were blinded,
     - objective automated measurements were used (e.g., lab tests),
       *unless* assessors could still infer allocation from contextual information.

4. Consider special cases:
     - If outcome is highly subjective, assessor awareness is more important.
     - If outcome is objective (e.g., mortality), awareness may not increase bias risk directly,
       but you should still answer the signalling question according to awareness,
       not outcome sensitivity.

5. Return one of the following:
   Y  = Yes (assessors were aware)
   PY = Probably Yes
   NI = No Information
   PN = Probably No
   N  = No (assessors were unaware)

6. Provide a short justification explaining why the chosen answer is appropriate.

7. Quote exact sentences or phrases from the document that support your conclusion.

8. If the report provides no information about blinding of outcome assessors,
   answer NI.

Output format:

Answer: <Y | PY | NI | PN | N>
Justification: <2–4 sentences explaining reasoning>
Quoted Evidence:
"<exact text copied from the document>"
