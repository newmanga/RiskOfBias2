Domain 4 – Question 4.5 (Bias in measurement of the outcome)
------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt:
You are evaluating Risk of Bias Domain 4:
“Bias in measurement of the outcome.”

This is Question 4.5:
“Is it likely that assessment of the outcome was influenced by knowledge of intervention received?”

Read the provided document.

Your tasks:

1. Consider BOTH:
     - Whether outcome assessors were aware of the intervention received (from Question 4.3),
     - Whether the type of outcome is susceptible to assessor judgment or interpretation (from Question 4.4).

2. Outcome assessment is likely to be influenced if:
     - assessors were aware of group assignments, AND
     - the outcome is subjective, clinician-rated, interview-based, or interpretive.

3. Influence is less likely but still possible if:
     - outcome is mostly objective but some interpretation is required,
     - assessors had partial or uncertain awareness of allocation.

4. Influence is unlikely if:
     - outcome is fully objective or mechanically measured,
     - automated systems or blinded centralized assessment were used,
     - clear blinding procedures prevented assessor awareness.

5. Return one of the following:
   Y  = Yes (influence is likely)
   PY = Probably Yes
   NI = No Information
   PN = Probably No
   N  = No (influence unlikely)

6. Provide a short justification explaining why the chosen answer is appropriate,
   explicitly referencing assessor awareness AND outcome type.

7. Quote exact sentences or phrases from the document that support your conclusion.

8. If neither assessor awareness nor outcome susceptibility is reported, answer NI.

Output format:

Answer: <Y | PY | NI | PN | N>
Justification: <2–4 sentences explaining reasoning>
Quoted Evidence:
"<exact text copied from the document>"
