Domain 2 – Question 2.6 (Effect of Assigment to Intervention)
-----------------------

Prompt:
You are evaluating Risk of Bias Domain 2, Question 2.6:
“Was an appropriate analysis used to estimate the effect of assignment to intervention?”  
(This refers to an intention-to-treat [ITT] effect.)

Read the provided document.

Your tasks:

1. Determine whether the analysis estimates the effect of assignment, not adherence.
   Appropriate analyses for ITT include:
     - intention-to-treat (ITT),
     - modified ITT (if exclusions are minimal and unrelated to deviations),
     - analyses that include all randomized participants in their assigned groups.

2. Identify inappropriate approaches, such as:
     - per-protocol or as-treated analyses,
     - excluding participants based on adherence,
     - reassigning participants to groups they actually received,
     - analyses that systematically remove deviators in a way likely to bias the estimate.

3. Determine whether the analysis was likely to be biased because of:
     - inappropriate exclusion of participants,
     - differential loss to follow-up,
     - deviations influencing who was included in analysis.

4. Return one of the following:
   Y  = Yes (appropriate analysis used)
   PY = Probably Yes
   NI = No Information
   PN = Probably No
   N  = No (inappropriate analysis used)

5. Provide a short justification explaining why the chosen answer is appropriate.

6. Quote exact sentences or phrases from the document that support your conclusion.

7. If no information about the analysis approach is reported, answer NI.

Output format:

Answer: <Y | PY | NI | PN | N>
Justification: <2–4 sentences explaining reasoning>
Quoted Evidence:
"<exact text copied from the document>"
