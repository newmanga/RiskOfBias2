Domain 2 – Question 2.7
-----------------------

Prompt:
You are evaluating Risk of Bias Domain 2, Question 2.7:
“Was there a substantial risk of bias due to deviations from intended intervention?”

Read the provided document.

Your tasks:

1. Review the answers to Questions 2.1–2.6 and the associated evidence to determine whether:
     - participants or carers were aware of assignment,
     - deviations occurred,
     - deviations were likely to affect the outcome,
     - deviations were unbalanced between groups,
     - the analysis appropriately estimated the ITT effect.

2. Determine whether the overall pattern of evidence indicates a substantial risk of bias.

3. Consider:
     - High risk if deviations likely biased the outcome AND were unbalanced, OR
       if the analysis was inappropriate (e.g., per-protocol/as-treated in ITT context).
     - Some concerns if information is incomplete or uncertainty exists.
     - Low risk if deviations were absent, balanced, unlikely to affect outcomes,
       AND an appropriate ITT analysis was used.

4. Return one of the following:
   Y  = Yes (there is substantial risk of bias)
   PY = Probably Yes
   NI = No Information (cannot judge)
   PN = Probably No
   N  = No (no substantial risk)

5. Provide a short justification explaining why the chosen answer is appropriate,
   clearly referencing earlier question responses when relevant.

6. Quote exact sentences or phrases from the document that support your conclusion.
   If there is no relevant information, answer NI and state that data is insufficient.

Output format:

Answer: <Y | PY | NI | PN | N>
Justification: <2–4 sentences explaining reasoning>
Quoted Evidence:
"<exact text copied from the document>"
