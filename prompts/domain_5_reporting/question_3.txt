Domain 5 – Question 5.3 (Bias in selection of the reported result)
------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt:
You are evaluating Risk of Bias Domain 5:
“Bias in selection of the reported result.”

This is Question 5.3:
“Were there multiple eligible analyses of the data?”

Read the provided document.

Your tasks:

1. Determine whether the data for this outcome could have been analyzed in multiple valid ways.

   Examples of multiple eligible analyses include:
     - different statistical models,
     - different covariate adjustments,
     - multiple subgroup analyses,
     - alternative approaches for handling missing data,
     - flexible modeling choices (e.g., parametric vs. nonparametric),
     - different ways of summarizing repeated-measures data,
     - per-protocol vs. ITT vs. modified ITT analyses.

2. Consider whether the trial:
     - reported only one analytic approach despite many possible alternatives,
     - does not justify why a specific analysis was chosen,
     - appears to select methods that favor statistically significant results,
     - mentions analyses in protocol or registry that differ from those reported.

3. Evidence of multiple eligible analyses may include:
     - description of several statistical options,
     - SAP or protocol listing multiple possible methods,
     - incomplete or selective reporting of analytic decisions.

4. Return one of the following:
   Y  = Yes (multiple eligible analyses existed)
   PY = Probably Yes
   NI = No Information
   PN = Probably No
   N  = No (only one legitimate analysis existed)

5. Provide a short justification explaining why the chosen answer is appropriate.

6. Quote exact sentences or phrases from the document that support your conclusion.

7. If the document does not describe analytic choices in enough detail to judge,
   answer NI.

Output format:

Answer: <Y | PY | NI | PN | N>
Justification: <2–4 sentences explaining reasoning>
Quoted Evidence:
"<exact text copied from the document>"
