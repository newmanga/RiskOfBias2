Domain 5 – Question 5.2 (Bias in selection of the reported result)
------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt:
You are evaluating Risk of Bias Domain 5:
“Bias in selection of the reported result.”

This is Question 5.2:
“Were there multiple eligible outcome measurements (e.g., scales, definitions, time points) within the outcome domain?”

Read the provided document.

Your tasks:

1. Determine whether the outcome domain (e.g., pain, depression, blood pressure, mortality)
   could have been measured in multiple different ways.

   Examples of multiple eligible measurements include:
     - different scales or instruments measuring the same construct,
     - different definitions for the same clinical event,
     - multiple time points at which the same outcome was collected,
     - alternative scoring methods (e.g., total score, subscales).

2. Identify whether the study:
     - collected outcome data at multiple possible time points,
     - recorded outcome data using multiple instruments or definitions,
     - had several analytic options for defining or scoring the outcome.

3. Recognize potential for selective reporting:
     - If multiple measurements were available but only one was reported,
     - If the reported measurement appears chosen post hoc,
     - If alternative measurements are mentioned but not analyzed.

4. Return one of the following:
   Y  = Yes (multiple eligible outcome measurements existed)
   PY = Probably Yes
   NI = No Information
   PN = Probably No
   N  = No (only one measurement approach existed)

5. Provide a short justification explaining why the chosen answer is appropriate.

6. Quote exact sentences or phrases from the document that support your conclusion.

7. If the document does not describe how the outcome was measured or whether
   multiple possible methods existed, answer NI.

Output format:

Answer: <Y | PY | NI | PN | N>
Justification: <2–4 sentences explaining reasoning>
Quoted Evidence:
"<exact text copied from the document>"
