Domain 5 – Question 5.1 (Bias in selection of the reported result)
------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt:
You are evaluating Risk of Bias Domain 5:
“Bias in selection of the reported result.”

This is Question 5.1:
“Were the data that produced this result analysed in accordance with a prespecified analysis plan that was finalized before unblinded outcome data were available?”

Read the provided document.

Your tasks:

1. Look for evidence that the analysis plan for this specific result was:
     - prespecified,
     - finalized before unblinded data were available,
     - included in a protocol or statistical analysis plan (SAP),
     - registered in a trial registry (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov).

2. Indicators of prespecification include:
     - explicit reference to a protocol or SAP,
     - registration that includes outcome definitions and analysis methods,
     - statements such as “analysis was prespecified before data lock.”

3. Indicators of *absence* of prespecification include:
     - no protocol or SAP available,
     - changes to analyses after seeing data,
     - exploratory analyses labeled as primary,
     - reporting methods not described in advance.

4. Consider whether outcome definitions, statistical models, covariates, subgroup analyses,
   or handling of missing data appear to have been chosen post hoc.

5. Return one of the following:
   Y  = Yes (analysis was prespecified)
   PY = Probably Yes
   NI = No Information
   PN = Probably No
   N  = No (analysis not prespecified or modified after unblinding)

6. Provide a short justification explaining why the chosen answer is appropriate.

7. Quote exact sentences or phrases from the document (protocols, SAP, registry entries, or manuscript) 
   that support your conclusion.

8. If there is no information about prespecification of the analysis plan, answer NI.

Output format:

Answer: <Y | PY | NI | PN | N>
Justification: <2–4 sentences explaining reasoning>
Quoted Evidence:
"<exact text copied from the document>"
